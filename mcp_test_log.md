# MCP Server Test Log

Date: 4/14/2025, 7:23 PM (America/Chicago, UTC-5:00)

## Environment Configuration
- MCP Server: basic-mcp-server
- URL: http://localhost:7500
- Docker container running via docker-compose

## Available Tools
- **example**: A tool that processes input text
  - Required parameter: `input` (string)
  - Returns processed text

## Test Actions

1. **Attempted to use example tool** - Failed
   - Error: "Not connected"
   - Possible issue: Docker container not running or not accessible

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Check if Docker container is running
   - Container ID: 27c91795cc34
   - Status: Up 2 minutes
   - Ports: 0.0.0.0:7500->7500/tcp
   - Name: amazing_booth

2. ✅ Check if server is responding to HTTP requests
   - HTTP 200 OK from /sse endpoint
   - Content-Type: text/event-stream
   - Server is running and accepting connections

3. ✅ Check Docker container logs for potential issues
   - Server is starting up correctly: "Starting MCP server on 0.0.0.0:7500"
   - SSE connections are being established: "New SSE connection from Address..."
   - All expected endpoints are responding correctly
   - No error messages in logs

4. ✅ Examine MCP server implementation
   - `server.py`: Correctly implements the MCP server with the "example" tool
   - `main.py`: Sets up SSE endpoints and Starlette routes correctly
   - `config.py`: Properly configured using pydantic-settings
   - All components appear to be working correctly

## Analysis of Issues

After testing, we've determined:
1. ✅ Docker container is running correctly
2. ✅ MCP server is properly configured and responding
3. ✅ Server logs show normal operation with no errors
4. ❌ Claude's MCP tool connection fails with "Not connected" error

## Possible Solutions

1. VSCode extension may need refreshing or reconnection:
   - Check the Claude extension configuration
   - Try restarting VSCode
   - Ensure the MCP connection is properly established in the Claude extension

2. Review the MCP settings file:
   - Confirmed server is not disabled in `cline_mcp_settings.json`
   - URL is correctly set to http://localhost:7500
   - Server name matches "basic-mcp-server"

3. Network/connectivity issues:
   - Ensure localhost:7500 is accessible from Claude's extension
   - Check for any network isolation between the extension and Docker

## Current Status

MCP server is operational, but Claude's connection to the server is not working.
