# MCP Server Implementation Resources

This repository contains resources for implementing MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, specifically for integrating with external APIs and services.

## Contents

1. **`setup_jira_mcp_server.sh`**: An automated script that generates a complete Jira MCP server project
2. **`mcp_server_implementation_guide.md`**: A comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing MCP servers

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Create a Jira MCP Server

To create a complete Jira MCP server project structure:

1. Make the setup script executable (already done):
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_jira_mcp_server.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./setup_jira_mcp_server.sh
   ```

   **Command-line options:**
   ```
   Usage: ./setup_jira_mcp_server.sh [OPTIONS]

   Options:
     -n, --name NAME     Specify project name (default: jira-mcp-server)
     --no-git            Skip Git repository initialization
     --no-github         Skip GitHub repository creation
     -h, --help          Show help message
   ```

3. Follow the instructions that appear after the script runs:
   - Navigate to the newly created project directory
   - Configure your Jira credentials in the `.env` file
   - Build and run the Docker container

The script automatically:
- Creates the complete project structure with all necessary files
- Initializes a Git repository (unless `--no-git` is specified)
- Creates a GitHub repository and pushes the code (if GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated)
- Makes all necessary scripts executable

This will create a fully functional MCP server that integrates with Jira, allowing AI assistants to interact with your Jira instance through the MCP protocol.

### Option 2: Understand MCP Server Implementation

If you want to learn more about how MCP servers work and how to implement them:

1. Read the comprehensive guide in `mcp_server_implementation_guide.md`
2. The guide covers:
   - Project structure and setup
   - Implementing MCP servers with FastMCP
   - Docker containerization
   - Testing strategies
   - Deployment options
   - Best practices

## Customizing for Other Services

The Jira MCP server can be used as a template for creating MCP servers for other services:

1. Generate the Jira MCP server project using the setup script
2. Replace the Jira-specific code with code for your target service:
   - Modify `src/services/` to implement your service integration
   - Update `src/server.py` to define tools and resources for your service
   - Update `src/config.py` to include the necessary configuration variables
   - Update `.env.example` with appropriate environment variables

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for communication between AI assistants and external services. It enables AI assistants to:

- Discover and call tools that perform actions
- Access resources that provide information
- Interact with external systems through a standardized interface

By implementing an MCP server, you can extend the capabilities of AI assistants by giving them access to your services and data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
